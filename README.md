The notebook focuses on text generation or sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It utilises pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library, such as GPT-2, to work with text data.

---

Approach

Text Processing:

- Loading, cleaning, and preparing text data.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model Usage:

- Uses a pre-trained language model, Hugging Face. The model is used for tasks such as text generation or predicting sentiment.
- The default model (openai-community/gpt2) was used for text generation without specifying a model name.

Example Outputs:

- The notebook includes examples of text generation, where an initial phrase is extended by the model.
- Example: "In this course, I will teach you how toâ€¦" was extended with generated content related to building WordPress sites.

Analysis Type

- Text Generation: Extending given text using a language model.
- Sentiment Analysis: Predicting the sentiment of text data (positive, negative, or neutral).

Execution

- Loaded a pre-trained model
- Text Generation
- Pipeline Execution
